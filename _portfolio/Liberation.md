Being a big fan of bullet hell games like The Binding of Isaac and Nuclear throne as well as survivor games like Brotato and Vampire survivor, I wanted to make my own version. Nothing too fancy here, just a regular point and shoot at the baddies to make them go away. Players shoot for the highest possible score before the accelerating enemy spawns overwhelm them. To make decisions a little more interesting, I added an ammo managment mechanic whereby the player must make the most of their piercing bullets by aligning shots properly.
