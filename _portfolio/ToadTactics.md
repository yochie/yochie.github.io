This game was developed in collaboration with some friends who were responsible for most of the game design and visual art while I handled the development along with the remaining aspects (audio, UI, animations, etc). As this was my first experience in game development, there were a lot of twists and turns on the road. In retrospect I can say we probably should have limited the scope where possible to allow more time for polishing. Still, I'm pretty satisfied with the end result and I learned a ton through the process.

#### The game

Toad tactics is an online PvP turn-based strategy game where you lead your toad team to victory by taking down your opponent's King. Teams are drafted from a pool of characters that each have their own special abilities and stats. After building their team, each player chooses a character to be their King. Games are played over 3 rounds with each one ending when a king is killed. The first player to win 2 rounds is declared victorious.

During a round, characters take turns based on their initiative as displayed at the top of the screen. Each turn, characters can do each of the following in any order :
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
* Attack
* Move
* Use an ability
* Use the catapult if available
{: style="text-align: left;"}

After each round, players can augment their characters stats by drafting equipments that they assign to their toads.

There is a lot more to it but it's easier to have a look at the clips below than explain it all.
