Toad tactics is an online PvP turn-based strategy game where you lead your toad team to victory by taking down your opponent's King. Teams are drafted from a pool of characters that each have their own special abilities and stats. After building their team, each player chooses a character to be their King. Games are played over 3 rounds with each one ending when a king is killed. The first player to win 2 rounds is declared victorious.

After each round, players can augment their characters stats by drafting equipments that they assign to their toads.

During a round, characters take turns based on their initiative as displayed at the top of the screen. Each turn, characters can do each of the following in any order :
